# European-Studies-Quiz

As part of my Lower 6th A-Level Coursework (2014-2015) for Software Systems Development, I had to create a quiz for the European Studies society in my school. 

The quiz is a C# Windows Console Application. If a valid username is entered to the system, the user will be taken through a series of questions with the aim being to correctly complete the questions in the shortest time with the highest score. 

The questions are a mixed of drag and drop, multiple choice and radio buttons. The user can see their name, avatar, score and time for the duration of the game. Once the game is over, a leaderboard showing the users who correctly answered all of the questions is displayed with the quickest user at the top.
